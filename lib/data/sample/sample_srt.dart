String default_raw_caption = '''1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,592
Some of the biggest struggles that I have
faced.

2
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:05,328
Inquiries specifically, is not being taken
seriously.

3
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:06,208
As a teacher.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,688
They think we're all like losers back home

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,088
that come here because we have no other
options

6
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:13,824
in, like America or wherever you're from.

7
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:16,224
I don't want to sound weird and saying so,
but

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,568
I feel special here

9
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,640
I feel like I'm really required to be
here. The

10
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:22,752
supply of English teachers is low

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,352
and the demand is always high compared to
the supply.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,232
Hey, bosses, it's Stephen formation boss.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,208
Teaching English has always been one of
the most popular jobs.

14
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:35,328
For english-speaking foreigners and expats
in Asia

15
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:37,824
and South Korea is no exception.

16
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:40,368
But have you ever wondered what it's
really like to

17
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:42,720
be an English teacher in South Korea?

18
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:46,608
We're able to invite a group of English
teachers to share their honest thoughts.

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,720
Let's see what they have to say.

20
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:50,544
Where are you from?

21
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:51,648
And how long have you been

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,472
an English teacher here in Korea?

23
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:57,936
Hello, my name is ren, and I have been an
English teacher

24
00:00:58,128 --> 00:00:59,088
here.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,160
Oh, almost

26
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,248
10 years

27
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:03,552
now and I am from Texas,

28
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:04,608
so I'm from

29
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:05,776
Australia

30
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,872
and I think all up it's been about

31
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,360
5.5 years.

32
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:12,144
I'm from Saint Louis, Missouri, in the US.

33
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:14,208
I've been teaching English

34
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:16,320
for over 4 years.

35
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:19,152
Well, I'm originally from Lincoln,
Nebraska,

36
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:21,408
but grew up in Kent City, Missouri, in the
United States.

37
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:23,232
I came to Korea

38
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,448
I've been here for over 25 years, I think,

39
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:28,848
and I've taught just a little bit
everybody.

40
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,288
So I'm from Dallas, Texas.

41
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:31,728
I've been here for about

42
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:32,752
14 months,

43
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:33,736
maybe 15.

44
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:38,448
So I'm on my 2nd year I teach at a hogwon
and songbook, which is like NE soul,

45
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,936
and what is a

46
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:42,816
hogwon? It's like a after-school Academy,
so

47
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:45,072
it's not public school and it's not a
like, um,

48
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:46,896
uh, International school,

49
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:48,144
private Academy.

50
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,640
Why did you choose to become an English
teacher in Korea,

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,608
as opposed to any other Asia countries?

52
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:54,184
Umm,

53
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:55,632
I moved here for a boy,

54
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:57,648
a Korean boy,

55
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:58,848
and I thought,

56
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:00,768
why not Korea?

57
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,784
It's become a popular place to go.

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
The food's amazing.

59
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:07,968
I'm not a k-pop Stan or one of those

60
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,656
foreigners who moves there for that
reason. But

61
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,968
I really got into Korean cinema like

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,320
parasite,

63
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,328
you know, and

64
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:18,912
squid game. Obviously,

65
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,720
so

66
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:22,272
I wanted to see what all the fuss was
about is, well,

67
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:27,648
I found out about this job in the days
when there were

68
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,376
placement agencies

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,392
and they would advertise in the newspaper

70
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:33,168
and say, teach in Korea,

71
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:36,816
and it was the only interesting job I saw
in the newspaper.

72
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:38,304
All the other teaching jobs were

73
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:40,464
too. I really want to go there are real
and I teach

74
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:42,096
there, but the said teach in Korea,

75
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:45,120
and I checked, is that North Korea or
South Korea?

76
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:49,008
Because I've never heard of the idea of
amalgamating these together,

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,888
culturally speaking, and say, okay, South
Korea?

78
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,576
It appears that a teaching English is one
of the most

79
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,784
common jobs for foreigners here in Korea.

80
00:02:56,784 --> 00:03:00,048
Why do you think so many foreigners want
to become English teachers here in Korea?

81
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,408
That's a good question, I mean, in my
experience, there's

82
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,280
2 types of people coming to teach English.

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,536
There's people like me who just kind of
want to see

84
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:10,704
the world a bit more experience, a new
culture, do something fun,

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,536
and then you have these like socially
awkward k-pop

86
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,312
fans that come here and think Korea's like

87
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,808
exact, like what they see on these
k-dramas and

88
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,920
watching bts and stuff, and there are

89
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,840
those people who never have a good time
being.

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,296
English teacher in Korea is not the most
common job, it is the most common

91
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:28,704
job for westerners and white people in
Korea.

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,360
A lot of people these days are influenced
by the hallyu wave to come to Korea

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,440
and

94
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:39,552
Korea, as cultural export in the world is
very, very strong.

95
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:43,968
I don't know if it's necessarily that they
want to become English teachers.

96
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,120
I think it's just

97
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:48,432
the easiest thing to do when you 1st get

98
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:51,072
here, especially if you have your
bachelor's degree.

99
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:53,760
And so what are the main requirements, and

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,872
how strict are they to become an English
teacher?

101
00:03:56,688 --> 00:04:00,816
You need to pass drug tests, you need to
have a clean criminal

102
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,696
for your bachelor's degree, and

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,184
basically that's the minimum,

104
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:09,024
and then you can have like you know, tesol
certificates, tefl certificates,

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
master's degrees, help

106
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:13,920
diplomas also help the interview process.

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,504
I got rejected

108
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:17,104
by a

109
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:18,864
quite a few schools, actually,

110
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,080
because I think what they were looking for
was more of a

111
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:23,760
foreigner face.

112
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,248
I'm ethnically Korean,

113
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
and

114
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:29,376
so I think that they wanted to have, like

115
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:33,504
somebody not ethnically Korean, teaching
the children and expose them to that.

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,568
You need to be a passport holder from

117
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,920
one of the 7

118
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,120
english-speaking

119
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:40,048
countries,

120
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,664
even though there's more than so.

121
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:42,864
I've had friends

122
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:44,496
who are not from

123
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:47,376
one of the 7 english-speaking countries,

124
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,200
maybe from Poland,

125
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:50,296
and

126
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:51,984
they have gotten

127
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:54,672
a job teaching English.

128
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:58,128
And I've actually had some instances

129
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,760
where we were both

130
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,488
interviewing

131
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:02,976
for the same position.

132
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:04,624
But

133
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:06,432
the white person got higher

134
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:08,976
and I've had hogwon owners say to me,

135
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:10,024
oh,

136
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,808
this job for whiteface

137
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:17,424
just flat out, say it to me, like say it
to my face so

138
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:19,056
well, at least

139
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:21,888
in that case there were just honest about
it.

140
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:24,384
I've seen job just

141
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:28,224
jaw. I've seen job postings, job
announcements

142
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
online,

143
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,352
and they'll say this job is for female
from the uk

144
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,712
or this job is not for a male

145
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:37,056
from South Africa.

146
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,456
So sometimes it's very detailed,

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,376
completely clean criminal record,

148
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,440
like you can have any anything on your
record.

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,928
I had to have something remove from my
record

150
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,416
of before I came here because I had a

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,048
little too much fun in college once,

152
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,344
so that cost me about

153
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:50,832
\$1000 to

154
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:52,752
to have that removal.

155
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,432
I came to Korea because they're so strict
here,

156
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,592
but other nats really easy

157
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,368
will cut that out.

158
00:05:58,368 --> 00:05:59,904
So your employer doesn't see that.

159
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,016
Oh dear, I

160
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,680
do you need to speak Korean to become an
English teacher in Korea.

161
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,800
You don't need to speak it, but it
seriously helps.

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
If you'll teaching beginners, because when
their level is like

163
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:16,608
all hi, my name is

164
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:18,384
awe,

165
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:19,408
then

166
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,168
you're kind of skirt.

167
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,088
My Korean is horrible.

168
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:25,728
For as long as I've been here, I have
probably the worst

169
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:26,880
student of Korean

170
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:28,752
ever in the history of language.

171
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:31,296
If you go by percentage of time, stayed

172
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,320
versus amount acquired,

173
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:35,512
so

174
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,816
they haven't kicked me out yet

175
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,832
and they probably won't kick you out
either.

176
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,752
No, you don't need to speak Korean

177
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,336
a in your

178
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,696
kind of daily life, outside of work, it
helps,

179
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:47,952
but actually inside of the classroom.

180
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,872
It's preferable that you don't speak
Korean,

181
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:52,320
because once you start speaking Korean,

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,472
the kids

183
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,200
will not speak English. So

184
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,888
if you don't mind us asking, how much does
a typical

185
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,664
English teacher make per month in Korea?

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,544
Maybe lowest, I've seen something like to
point

187
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:04,656
to, or something which feels really low to
me.

188
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,856
Maybe average around

189
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:10,176
3,000,000 won. And then,

190
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:12,960
baby,

191
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:15,552
I mean, I think some places you could push
for

192
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:17,904
about you'd probably have to work like
really

193
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:18,736
a

194
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:19,872
big hours like,

195
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:23,088
umm, I think the most experienced teachers
may be.

196
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:24,960
You know they would work 35 hours a week.

197
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:30,288
That's like teaching hours, and maybe they
would push for or just go over for.

198
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,256
For me personally, I make

199
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,968
before taxes, insurance, and anything like
that I make about 3.2,000,000 won a month.

200
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,080
And then, after all, the stuff is
deducted.

201
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,056
I believe it's about 2.9,000,000 a month,
which, with the

202
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,744
roughly 1300, something

203
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:49,056
a want us dollar exchange, is about

204
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,312
to kamath 2000 us dollars a month.

205
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:54,528
The introductory wage for a first-time
English teacher in Korea

206
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:57,120
has not risen since 2002.

207
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:59,328
For 21 years.

208
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:02,832
The basic wage of an average English
teacher has not increased.

209
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,440
It is now 2.1,000,000, 1,100,000 won a
month.

210
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:09,648
Now. That is minimum

211
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:10,528
wage.

212
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,768
Most schools offer housing

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,072
for their English teachers, which is
great.

214
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:16,512
However, the quality of housing

215
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:18,720
really really depends on the school.

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,688
Most English teachers in Korea

217
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:22,144
come

218
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,904
to houses where

219
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:27,600
departments are filled with black mold and
they get lung diseases

220
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:29,328
from these

221
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,400
houses that where Koreans themselves won't
even rent

222
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,656
because they're the cheapest, dirtiest
apartment

223
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:35,704
in the city.

224
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,680
I came in to a very

225
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,752
molded and dirty house actually filled
with that.

226
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:41,904
Teachers. Things still

227
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,112
because they told me she was supposed to
be gone,

228
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:46,272
and when I came she wasn't actually gone.

229
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:47,248
So

230
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:49,200
then I had to stay at the

231
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:53,328
hog one owners house, the supervisors
house and the hogwon owner's house.

232
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:55,488
That was not fun and that was with my
baby.

233
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:57,552
Oh, wow, so,

234
00:08:57,648 --> 00:08:59,808
do you have a baby here in Korea?

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Are you married to a Korean?

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,848
I am actually a single mom, though my
daughter is half Korean.

237
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:06,288
So I

238
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,640
yeah, I'm on a whole adventure here.

239
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:13,488
And so what are some of your biggest
struggles as an English teacher in Korea?

240
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,504
Ou,

241
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,336
in my case, work-life balance?

242
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:20,032
I have

243
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,088
I have a little trouble going to the gym

244
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,912
and getting some of that stuff done.

245
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:27,936
I want to throw myself into this or that
project,

246
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:31,920
and I've had to slowly teach myself no,
get back

247
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,984
to the real world, get back to

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,384
taking care of yourself, etc.

249
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:37,920
So for me

250
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,752
a lot of

251
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:40,416
for me, it's like balancing time.

252
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:43,680
I think some of my biggest struggles have
been the

253
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:45,120
work expectations.

254
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,384
I used to work a remote tech related

255
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:51,264
9 to 5 job 40 hours a week just working
from home.

256
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:54,672
So obviously my expectation of what I need
to do for work was lot lower,

257
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:58,848
whereas now I'm spending on some days, 11
hours at my Academy.

258
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,776
Granted not, that entire time is spent on
work. A lot of its,

259
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:04,704
you know, lunchtimes breaks stuff like
that.

260
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,664
In between classes.

261
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:08,976
However, it is just a lot more actual work
required.

262
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,520
Some of the biggest struggles that I have
faced inquiries,

263
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,728
specifically, is not being taken
seriously.

264
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:14,608
As a teacher,

265
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,080
a lot of the students

266
00:10:16,176 --> 00:10:19,440
think English time is just break time or
playtime.

267
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:21,600
A lot of the administrative

268
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,048
staff of schools

269
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:27,408
do not take complaints of foreign English
teachers seriously.

270
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:30,144
This is especially concerning if you work
in a private school,

271
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,880
because in Korea, Korea, as a capitalist
society,

272
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:34,896
profit rules everything.

273
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:35,968
That's not.

274
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:38,160
That's not necessarily a problem all of
the time,

275
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:41,280
but one complaint from a parent

276
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,872
and some English teachers are jobless and
homeless

277
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:45,696
in a country whose language they do not
speak.

278
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:50,016
Because again your boss es your landlord,
your boss controls you're housing,

279
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,040
your boss controls your rental contract,

280
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,440
so if you're out of a job, you're also out
of a house.

281
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
So a lot of foreign English teachers

282
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,560
feel like they're constrained.

283
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:00,624
Where if they do have a problem?

284
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:02,112
If a student is misbehaving

285
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,184
a lot of The Times, the parents will say,

286
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,920
what did you do to make my child act that
way?

287
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:10,608
How do you think English teachers are
perceived

288
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,960
by Korean society in general these days?

289
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:14,416
How does

290
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:16,992
a good question? I don't know when I when
I 1st came

291
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:19,536
10 years ago, I heard things like

292
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:23,280
you know? Some people had to negative
stereotypes, for example, like

293
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:24,208
they couldn't

294
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,496
get jobs in their own country, so that's
why

295
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,792
they're out here.

296
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,192
They think we're all like losers back home

297
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:32,640
that come here because we have no other
options

298
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,376
in, like America or wherever you're from.

299
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,344
So they think we're just like these,

300
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:39,840
which a lot of people are just weird
people to come here

301
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:40,768
just to

302
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:41,904
try and meet checks,

303
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,208
other stereotypes.

304
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,992
A lot of people think I'm in a military I
do know if that's a stereotype,

305
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:48,136
but I guess I got

306
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:49,248
all all day.

307
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,176
I also have like

308
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,320
2 big tattoos that you can see right now,
so

309
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,664
that doesn't help my image.

310
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,456
I think some people treat it as a bit of a
Mickey Mouse job.

311
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,152
Umm,

312
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:00,472
you know you're

313
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:01,432
kind of

314
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:02,728
and you'll

315
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:04,320
like glorified baby-sitter,

316
00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:06,816
but it's actually really really hot.

317
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,640
It takes a lot out of you.

318
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:12,000
It takes a lot of skills to be speaking
all the time and be like

319
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,544
constantly switched on for the kids.

320
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,848
And then there's the classroom management
and

321
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,880
its

322
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:19,936
I wouldn't.

323
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:21,840
I don't know many people

324
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,664
who would be able to do it honestly.

325
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:24,784
So

326
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:29,520
what's the most rewarding part for you
about being an English teacher in Korea

327
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,920
when the kids are having a hard day

328
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,136
and you're able to make it better, because
again, the expectations

329
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:37,200
that are pushed on them in this country
are pretty

330
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,592
pretty strong,

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,184
pretty hard to achieve for any kid.

332
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:45,648
So sometimes being able to teach them
something

333
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,432
and help their odds in this country, while
also

334
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:52,800
helping them kind of chill out or com
town, or

335
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,632
feel little bit better about themselves is
nice.

336
00:12:55,632 --> 00:12:58,368
I've had a lot of kids that just break out
and crying for no reason, and

337
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,864
I know it's because of expectations that
are pushed onto them.

338
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,888
So being able to kind of give them a hug
in that situation have them

339
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,520
happy at the end of the class.

340
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,104
Definitely one of the most annoying
things.

341
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:08,224
Oh man,

342
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,136
I'm not going to. I'm not going to lie and
make up some nonsense about

343
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:13,344
how I love working with kids, and it's
like the most

344
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:16,656
exhilarating thing, and I love making a
difference in these kids lives.

345
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,856
It gets fun, they're cute,

346
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,544
but I'm not doing this because I'm
passionate about teaching

347
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,032
I do is because

348
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:24,816
it's a cool experience, and my job is
really easy.

349
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,080
As far as most rewarding thing, I think
would just be

350
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,568
like to stress free life. I live

351
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:30,864
like my job is very,

352
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,008
very easy,

353
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:32,848
not stressful.

354
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,944
Living in careers pretty non stressful,
you know.

355
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:35,856
I don't have to worry about.

356
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:39,072
Go into a bar and get shot by some crazy
dude.

357
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:41,232
You know like I do back home. So it's

358
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:42,960
that would probably be the most rewarding
part.

359
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:46,896
O the most rewarding part of my students.

360
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,048
You know their growth

361
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:48,904
and

362
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,936
English language and also just the love
they give me

363
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:52,944
like actually

364
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:57,264
Friday, umm, I just had a student I was so
sad cause I forgot to bring it with me.

365
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:58,848
She wrote me a little note because she
said,

366
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,008
oh teatar, are you okay now?

367
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,880
And I said oh no, teacher still little

368
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:03,936
little hurting.

369
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:04,944
Stomach hurts and

370
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:08,496
awe. And then she wrote a little note
issues that sounds anyway. I'll put him on

371
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:09,696
my cell and

372
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,760
that says teacher please don't hurt

373
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:13,872
like please don't be in pain. And I was
like

374
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,024
oh you're so sweet.

375
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:17,376
And then she said, turn turn and I was
like okay.

376
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,200
And the other side's I said something
sounding out

377
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:21,456
and it's a teacher I love you. So

378
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:25,344
you know, even if I'm so stressed out from
that job

379
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,368
and some some of the students you know

380
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:32,592
that just brings me so much joy and always
reminds you know this is why I do it.

381
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:36,384
You know these students the they love me
and they are here to learn.

382
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,112
And I can't let you know

383
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,504
those few students.

384
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,808
You know ruin it for the rest of these
students. And

385
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,824
what are your plans for the future?

386
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,816
I think I'll be here for a while.

387
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:50,064
Yeah. My partner lives here,

388
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,568
possibly teaching in like universities or

389
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,536
ah. Yeah. Maybe

390
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,504
you're working as a professor.

391
00:14:58,032 --> 00:15:01,632
So you see yourself staying here in Korea
for the foreseeable future.

392
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,080
It could be. It could be for good. Yeah.

393
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:10,272
Yeah. I want to continue my career in
communications media.

394
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:12,256
I'm

395
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,448
actually interested in going into
journalism

396
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:15,304
as well.

397
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:18,336
You see yourself going back to your home
country or

398
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:20,592
you know trying to find another drop in
Korea.

399
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,096
Ah,

400
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:24,096
I'm gonna be moving back to the uk.

401
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,584
I think it's better for

402
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,264
opportunities. As a foreigner.

403
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,240
It's

404
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:29,584
my home,

405
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,008
umm,

406
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,168
if you can speak Korean, you've got a

407
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,096
better chance of getting a job here if you
wanted to,

408
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,928
but it's the chances are quite small.

409
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:41,856
Last weekend I took South Korea
citizenship examination.

410
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:42,960
I qualified.

411
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:44,728
However,

412
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:46,704
I missed it by one point.

413
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:50,544
So I want to become a citizen of Korea
because, despite

414
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,992
all of its flaws, I really do love living
here.

415
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:57,072
Korea is a gorgeous country with 5000
years of art,

416
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,024
culture,

417
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:58,912
history,

418
00:15:59,168 --> 00:15:59,968
and it's

419
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:03,360
the only country I can never see myself
living in.

420
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:07,056
I don't see a future in the United States,
I don't see a future for myself there.

421
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:07,968
As an English teacher,

422
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:08,928
I'm actually

423
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:10,656
making a YouTube channel.

424
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,008
It's still in the process.

425
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,112
So, ah,

426
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,800
but the name will be huila English.

427
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:18,432
If I'm allowed to say that

428
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:19,888
am,

429
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,800
yeah. Once I start making the YouTube
channel,

430
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,576
it will promote my private business more.

431
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,544
Hopefully, I start getting more students.

432
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:29,088
I don't want to sound weird and saying so,
but

433
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:30,432
I feel special here.

434
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,504
I feel like I'm really required to be
here. The

435
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,616
supply of English teachers is low

436
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:39,216
and the demand is always high compared to
the supply.

437
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:43,440
But if I go back to London, it is, it's
just a dime a dozen person, you know.

438
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:46,272
So what's your advice to people watching
abroad who are

439
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,768
interested in becoming an English teacher
here in Korea?

440
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,928
Would be great be common English teacher.

441
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,128
Throw yourself into it.

442
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:53,376
Don't feel that you

443
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,728
don't, don't don't inhibit yourself.

444
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:56,976
If you're going well,

445
00:16:57,168 --> 00:17:00,768
the apartment is kind of shabby, the pay
is kind of shabby.

446
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:04,992
No 3 yourself into it, you know, after
working out, after taking care of yourself

447
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,920
and

448
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:09,408
screen out those people that aren't so
happy,

449
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:11,232
that fine

450
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,488
reasons to complain.

451
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:16,512
There are certainly reasons to complain
about it, but in general,

452
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,576
consider yourself fortunate

453
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,880
the kind of stuff that you can do here.

454
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,432
Korea booze, and a k-pop lovers can just
not

455
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:27,456
mention it in the interview, and though
that'll increase their chances, a lot

456
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:32,160
of my recruiter literally told me I don't
care if you love k-pop or k-drama.

457
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,600
Don't mention it in the interview

458
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:36,672
because you just look like you are

459
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,080
not appropriating, but you're appreciating
the wrong parts of the culture.

460
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:43,296
There is more to different Asian cultures
and countries

461
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:45,600
than just the media that's consumed

462
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,000
internationally. I don't even care if you
watch the good game

463
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,968
like 100 times or something like that.
That's not

464
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,120
everything here.

465
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,088
Yeah, that would be my advice.

466
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,152
Don't be a career, but please, please do.

467
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,312
Your research joined the Facebook groups

468
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,848
about teaching.

469
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,536
Ask people to check your contracts

470
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,464
go over, you know, ask for more money.

471
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:07,248
Please. We're trying to raise that base.

472
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,656
Pay amount to at least 2.5,000,000,
because

473
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:13,680
you know 2.1, 2.2, you know under 2.5.

474
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
It's really not cutting it

475
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:17,280
anymore, and people are struggling. People
are

476
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,528
costly asking

477
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,880
for food, donations and everything because

478
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,848
they just can't survive like that.

479
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:23,808
And please,

480
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:25,584
if you come as a teacher

481
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,744
makes her teaching us something you're

482
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:30,768
slightly even, slightly interested in,

483
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:33,504
because otherwise you know you're not
going to give

484
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,904
your best to those students, and they
definitely deserve

485
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,680
a teacher who's going to get their best?
