[wind gusting]

[World Soul] Anduin...

00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,667
[whooshing]

7
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,125
[approaching footsteps]

8
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,792
You're here to tell me
we don't get to hide.

9
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,083
Is that it?

10
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,667
You needed time.

11
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,125
We stayed away.

12
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:19,292
But time by itself heals nothing.

13
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,917
You didn't just come here for me.

14
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,875
It's the visions.

15
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,333
You've seen them.

16
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,708
I suspect many have, lately.

17
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,583
Something,

18
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,000
someone,

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,458
is calling out
from the heart of the world.

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,708
Like a voice from a dream.

21
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,708
[ominous orchestral music]

22
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:14,708
Something dark is coming, Anduin.

23
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:20,375
The world needs your Light again.

24
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,833
[Varian] My son...

25
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,250
[breathing heavily]

26
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,042
[yells]

27
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,917
I am not that person anymore!

28
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,208
I have no Light.

29
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,083
Not after what I've seen.

30
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,250
Not after what I've done.

31
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,333
You are not your past, Anduin.

32
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,583
I trust you.

33
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,792
[majestic orchestral music]

34
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,833
[high-pitched screeching]

35
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,042
[World Soul] Hear me!

36
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,542
They're getting worse.

37
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,042
Look,

38
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,250
whatever's coming,

39
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,125
I'll stand with you.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,167
Of course I will.

41
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:00,917
But we were drawn here by the voice.

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,250
Who is it, Thrall?

43
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,500
Who's calling out to us?

44
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,167
I'm not sure yet.

45
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,582
But that sword

46
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,542
was aimed at someone.

47
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,625
[ominous orchestral music]

48
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,750
